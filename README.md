# Full-stack Code Challenge

This challenge consists of displaying the results of an API call using React and TypeScript.

The goal here is for us to get a basic understanding of how you code, so it's not meant to be very difficult. Ideally you shouldn't spend more than a few hours on it.

## Setup

We recommend starting from a basic template (e.g. [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), or something similar) -- though it's also fine if you have a different preferred way of bootstrapping a project.


## API

Using [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest), fetch Github issues from the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) github repository.

Optionally, [Github GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql) can be used instead.

## App

Write a basic single page application that displays a list of the issues returned in this API call. There are no explicit requirements for which fields you should include in the view (title, label, state, etc.). Feel free to go with whatever you think makes the most sense!

Ideally your submission should involve a component-based approach, and have a responsive layout (optimising for both mobile and web views).

## What we're looking for

With this challenge we're trying to get a sense of how you would architect a basic front end application. We're not looking for the prettiest solution. Rather- code readability, clean architecture are the main things we will be paying attention to.

## Sumission

For submission, please send us an email with a link to your project, ideally as a github repo. Oh, and don't forget to add a nice README.md so we know how to build & run it :)
